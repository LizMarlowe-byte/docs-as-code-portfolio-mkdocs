# docs-as-code-portfolio-mkdocs
A MkDocs + Material implementation of my technical writing portfolio, built to demonstrate docs‑as‑code practices, structured content authoring, and static site generator skills. This project includes organized Markdown content, reusable assets, and a customized navigation layout using the MkDocs Material theme.
