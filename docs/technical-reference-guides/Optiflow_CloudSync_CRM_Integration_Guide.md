### Overview

The Optiflow–CloudSync CRM integration uses a _push_ method, where data is pushed to Optiflow by CloudSync. _No data is sent from Optiflow back to CloudSync_.

Within CloudSync, the objects from which data is pushed for the integration include:

- **ChatSession**
- **SupportTicket**
- **VideoSession**
- **UserPresence**

Optiflow also requests updates for mapping purposes to ensure usernames, statuses, and groups remain synchronized for ease of use and setup.

This integration supports users of the **CloudSync Service Hub**, utilizing **Chat Sessions**, **Video Support**, and **Support Ticket** channels. The real-time monitoring feed leverages CloudSync’s Omnichannel presence to display active sessions in Optiflow dashboards.

!!! note
    The Optiflow–CloudSync CRM integration uses the available **CloudSync API suite** and does _not_ require installing any packages in your CloudSync environment. Some minor setup in CloudSync is required to provide authentication and populate the APIs with the required data.

#### Integration feeds

The three types of feeds available in the Optiflow–CloudSync CRM integration include:

- **Customer Interaction Metrics (CIM):** Provides details about customer engagement across channels.
- **Support Ticket Trends (STT):** Supplies historical data about ticket volumes and resolution times (used for forecasting and resource planning).
- **Live Session Monitoring (LSM):** Provides real-time visibility into active chat or video sessions (used for operational dashboards).

#### Configure adapters for feeds

Configure the relevant adapters in Optiflow to receive the feeds you want:

|CloudSync → Optiflow Feed            |Optiflow Adapter              |Purpose                                |
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
|Customer Interaction Metrics (CIM)   |CIM Adapter                 |Historical interaction analytics       |
|Support Ticket Trends (STT)           |STT Adapter                 |Ticket volume and resolution insights  |
|Live Session Monitoring (LSM)         |LSM Adapter                 |Real-time session visibility           |

### Target audience

This guide is intended for technical users who want to integrate Optiflow with CloudSync CRM using the platform’s supported APIs, authentication workflows, and configuration tools.

### Data retrieval flow

In the Optiflow–CloudSync CRM integration, CloudSync CRM pushes new events (Push Topics, Change Data Capture, or User Data) to the CloudSync CRM Adapter in the Optiflow system. 

The CloudSync CRM Adapter:

- Posts real-time data directly to the **Live Session Monitoring (LSM)** API.

- Aggregates trend and analytical data through a Data Processor, which posts this data to the **Support Ticket Trends (STT)** API and the **Customer Interaction Metrics (CIM)** API.

The following diagram illustrates this data flow, and the accompanying table describes each numbered step.

### Customer onboarding

The customer onboarding tasks for the Optiflow–CloudSync CRM integration are done by Optiflow and the customer.

Most of the setup for this integration is done by Optiflow. However, there are required setup tasks that the customer needs to do in CloudSync, including providing authentication for the API calls, and setting up the data that is pushed to the CloudSync CRM adapter in Optiflow. This includes, but is not limited to, the connected app, push topics, and change data capture setup.

The workflow includes the following steps:

| Step | Responsible | Name                    | Description                                                                  |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Optiflow    | Internal Authentication | Optiflow sets up the internal cloud authentication tokens to ensure that the adapter can communicate with the Optiflow tenant.   |
| 2    | Customer    | [Customer CloudSync CRM Setup](#customer-cloudsync-crm-setup)| The customer sets up the access flow from their CloudSync tenant to the Optiflow adapter. In addition, they enable the push topics and change data captures required for the desired channels. |
| 3    | Optiflow    | Deploy CloudSync CRM Adapter | Optiflow enables the adapter, and populates it with the required parameters to supply the data points required for the Optiflow tenant.    |


## 🛠️ Customer CloudSync CRM setup

The customer administrator needs to set up the access flow from their CloudSync tenant to the Optiflow adapter.

**Before you begin**

Obtain a public certificate file named **cloudsync.crt** from an Optiflow engineer.

**Procedure**

1. Open your Postman collection.

    If you are working with a CloudSync sandbox instance, make sure to use the following endpoint: https://test.cloudsync.com/services/oauth2/token (instead of the production endpoint: https://login.cloudsync.com/services/oauth2/token).

2. On the **Variables** tab, update the following key-value pairs with your credentials:

    - grant_type: **urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer**

    - userID: **<Your username>**

    - consumerKey: **<Your Consumer Key copied from the previous step>**
