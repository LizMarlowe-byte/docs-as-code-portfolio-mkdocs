# OpenWeatherMap API Guide
The _OpenWeatherMap API Guide_ describes a RESTful API that provides access to comprehensive weather data for developers.

---

## Overview { data-toc-label="Overview" }

The _OpenWeatherMap_ API is a weather data service that provides access to comprehensive data sourced from global and local models, satellites, radars, and weather stations. Developers can use the API to retrieve current weather conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, historical data, and bulk weather information for multiple locations worldwide.

### Common use cases

- Build real-time weather dashboards for websites or applications.
- Check weather forecasts for outdoor events and trigger contingency plans for extreme conditions.
- Monitor temperature, precipitation, and humidity for agriculture and crop management.
- Optimize delivery routes considering weather hazards for transportation.
- Adjust energy consumption based on temperature trends.
- Send emergency alerts for severe weather conditions, such as storms, hurricanes, and floods.

### Technical details

- Organized around REST principles with resource-oriented URLs.
- Supports JSON by default, with optional XML and HTML formats.
- Uses query parameters, standard HTTP response codes, and API key–based authentication.


### Target audience

This guide is intended for developers who want to integrate real-time, forecasted, or historical weather data into web, mobile, IoT, or backend applications using the OpenWeatherMap API. It assumes basic familiarity with HTTP requests, JSON, and API keys. Developers new to weather APIs can follow the step-by-step tutorial to get started quickly, while experienced developers can use the reference sections to implement specific products and query parameters.

---

## Base URL { data-toc-label="Base URL" }

OpenWeather uses multiple service hosts. 

Use the product‑specific host shown in each endpoint:

- **Current & 5‑day/3‑hour Forecast**: `https://api.openweathermap.org`  
- **Hourly Forecast (4 days, Pro plans)**: `https://pro.openweathermap.org`  
- **Geocoding (Direct/Reverse/ZIP)**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0`  
- **Historical & Statistical**: `https://history.openweathermap.org`  
- **Bulk (snapshots & 7‑day archives)**: `https://bulk.openweathermap.org`

All requests _must_ use **HTTPS**. For the correct path and parameters, see each endpoint section in [API reference](#api-reference).

---

## Authentication { data-toc-label="Authentication" }

The OpenWeatherMap API uses [API keys](#create-more-api-keys) to authenticate requests. All API requests _must_ be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP and API requests without authentication _will fail_.

### Headers

OpenWeather authenticates via the `appid` **query parameter** (no auth header). Include `appid` in every request.

For example:

```http
GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Boulder&appid=123abc456def
```

Where **appid=123abc456def** is your dedicated API key (passed as a query parameter).

---

## Rate limits { data-toc-label="Rate limits" }

A rate limit is the number of requests the API can receive in a specific time period. Rate limiting ensures efficient API performance and prevents abuse. Once the limit is reached, API requests from the client will fail.

Rate limits and billing vary by _product_ and _subscription_. For example, **One Call API 3.0 (by call)** includes **1,000 calls/day free**, and then **$0.0015 per call** beyond that daily quota. Before you ship, check each product’s pricing and limits. 

### Subscription Plans

Each tier offers specific rate limits and monthly quotas for API calls:

|Plan           |Calls Per Minute|Monthly Call Limit|
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:-------------|
|Startup        |600 calls/minute        |10 million calls|
|Developer      |3,000 calls/minute      |100 million calls|
|Professional   |30,000 calls/minute     |1 billion calls  |
|Expert         |100,000 calls/minute    |3 billion calls  |
|Enterprise     |200,000 calls/minute    |5 billion calls  |

> _**Note:** These values are intentionally normalized for portfolio demonstration and do _not_ reflect current OpenWeatherMap pricing tiers.


### Handling 429 errors (Too Many Requests)

If your application exceeds per‑minute or daily quotas, the API responds with an HTTP 429 error response. Implement exponential backoff and honor the `Retry-After` header (when available). Consider caching frequently requested data and batching requests. In addition, select a subscription tier aligned with your expected load. If repeated 429s occur, reduce call frequency or upgrade your plan.

---

## HTTP status and error codes { data-toc-label="HTTP status and error codes" }

Errors and statuses are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and a structured JSON body.


### Common HTTP status codes

|Code           |Description|When It Occurs|
|:--------------|:----------|:-------------|
|200            |OK         |Successful requests|
|400            |Bad Request|Validation errors, malformed JSON  |
|401            |Unauthorized|Missing/invalid API key|
|403            |Forbidden   |Insufficient permissions|
|404            |Not Found   |Resource does not exist|
|429            |Too Many Requests|Rate limited|
|500            |Server Error|Unexpected server-side error

---

## Pagination { data-toc-label="Pagination" }

Pagination allows you to retrieve large sets of data in smaller, manageable chunks by using specific parameters to limit the amount of data sent in each API response. 

Unlike many APIs, OpenWeatherMap does _not_ support traditional pagination mechanisms, such as `limit`, `offset`, or `page` parameters. Instead, it provides a simple way to control the number of results returned using the `cnt` parameter on certain endpoints.

### How `cnt` works

The `cnt` parameter specifies the maximum number of data points to return in the response. 

It is commonly used in the following forecast endpoints:

- **5‑day / 3‑hour Forecast** (`/data/2.5/forecast` on `api.openweathermap.org`): `cnt` limits the number of 3‑hour timestamps returned.  
- **Hourly Forecast (4 days, Pro)** (`/data/2.5/forecast/hourly` on `pro.openweathermap.org`): `cnt` limits the number of hourly timestamps.  
- **Daily Forecast (16 days)** (`/data/2.5/forecast/daily`): `cnt` limits the number of daily entries.

For example, the following API request returns 24 hourly forecast entries for London:

```

GET https://pro.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?lat=51.5085&lon=-0.1257&cnt=24&appid=YOUR_API_KEY

```
> **Note:** `cnt` only limits the number of results. It does _not_ provide true pagination (such as page numbers or offsets). To retrieve additional data, you must send separate requests with different parameters.

## Tutorial: Get current weather for a city { data-toc-label="Tutorial: Get current weather for a city" }

This tutorial describes how to retrieve the current weather for a specific city. It involves using your API key and testing it with curl (Client URL) to verify that the OpenWeatherMap API returns a valid response.

> **Note:** Curl is a command-line tool used to transfer data to or from a server using various protocols - most commonly **HTTP** and **HTTPS**.

### Before you begin

- Complete all of the [Getting Started](#getting-started) tasks, including creating an account and getting an API key.

- Verify that curl is installed on your computer:

   - For _macOS/Linux_, it is usually pre-installed. 
   - For _Windows_, [download and install curl](https://curl.se/windows/) or use Git Bash.

### Step 1: Copy your API key

From your [account page](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys), copy your API key. You will need this key for all API requests.

### Step 2: Get geographic coordinates of a location

Many OpenWeather endpoints accept city names (`q`), zip or postal codes, or coordinates. Some products (such as **One Call API 3.0**) require coordinates. In practice, using the Geocoding API to resolve to `lat`/`lon` is the most reliable way to target the correct location, especially for ambiguous city names.

Since most people do not know the geographic coordinates of locations by memory, there is an API request that allows you to retrieve this data for any location. To limit the number of locations with the same name returned in the API response, use the `limit` parameter.

Run the following request to get coordinates for your city:

```

https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city name},{state code},{country code}&limit={limit}&appid={API key}

```

**Query parameters**

|Parameter      |Description                                                                              |Type  |Required|Notes                     |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----|:-------|--------------------------| 
|`q`          |City name, state code (only for the US), or country code. |string|required|You do _not_ need to include all of this data. For example, you can only include the city name or only the country code. If you do include multiple attributes, they _must_ be separated by a comma.
|`limit`      |Maximum number of locations with the same name returned in the API response.|number|optional|                                                                                 
|`appid`      |Your unique API key, which you can access on your account page.                          |string|required|


**Sample request**

For example, to retrieve the geographic coordinates for the city of London in England, run the following request:

```

https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=London&limit=5&appid={API key}

```

The API response will be similar to the following:

```               
[
  {
    "name": "London",
    "local_names": {
      "ms": "London",
      "gu": "લંડન"
    },
    "lat": 51.5156177,
    "lon": -0.0919983,
    "country": "GB",
    "state": "England"
  }
]

```
Based on this response, the geographic coordinates for London, England are: `lat`:**51.5156177** and `lon`:**-0.0919983**.

> **Note:** This sample shows a subset of the full response. The actual response includes additional objects for the specified range.

### Step 3: Retrieve current weather data for London, England

Now that you know the geographic coordinates you need, run another API request that specifies retrieving the current weather for London, England.

For example:

```

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=51.5156177&lon=-0.0919983&appid={API key}&units=metric

```

Where the query parameters are:

- `lat`: Latitude coordinate of the location.
- `lon`: Longitude coordinate of the location.
- `appid=<YOUR_API_KEY>`: Your unique API key.

### Step 4: Verify a successful response

A successful response returns a 200 HTTP status code and JSON objects containing the current weather for London (using the geographic coordinates).

Verify that the response is successful:

```json

{
  "coord": { "lon": -0.1257, "lat": 51.5085 },
  "weather": [
    { "id": 500, "main": "Rain", "description": "light rain", "icon": "10d" }
  ],
  "main": { "temp": 12.34, "humidity": 81 },
  "name": "London"
}

```
Where the response elements are:

- `"coord": { "lon": -0.1257, "lat": 51.5085 }`: Coordinates for London, England.
- `"weather": [{ "description": "light rain" }]`: Human‑readable weather description.
- `"main": { "temp": 12.34, "humidity": 81 }`: Temperature in **Celsius** (because `units=metric`) and relative humidity.

If you get a similar response, you're all set up with the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Headers

The OpenWeatherMap API does _not_ require headers in the API requests.

#### Error responses

OpenWeather error payloads typically return a simple object with `cod` and `message` (strings or numbers).

For example:

```json

{"cod": "401", "message": "Invalid API key. Please see https://openweathermap.org/faq#error401 for more info."}

```

#### HTTP methods in OpenWeatherMap 

All OpenWeatherMap API endpoints are designed for data retrieval _only_, so they use **HTTP GET** requests by default. There are no POST, PUT, or DELETE methods because the API does _not_ allow creating, updating, or deleting resources—only retrieving weather data.

When using curl, you don’t need to specify **-X GET** because it’s the default method. 

For example:

```
curl "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=<YOUR_API_KEY>&units=metric"

```
If you want to be explicit, you can include **-X GET** but it's _not_ mandatory:

```

curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=<YOUR_API_KEY>&units=metric"

```
