# Introduction to Docmost

_Docmost_ is an open-source collaborative wiki that provides easy and robust content creation and real-time collaboration.

**Topics**:

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Workspaces, spaces, and pages](#workspaces-spaces-and-pages)
* [Key features](#key-features)
* [Target audience](#target-audience)

## Overview

Docmost allows multiple users to work on the same page in real time without overwriting the content of other users. It is an open-source collaborative wiki that provides an alternative to Notion and Confluence. You can use Docmost to manage a wiki, knowledge base, or even project documentation.

Docmost allows you to create, collaborate and share knowledge with dedicated collaborators or members. Create areas of collaboration, or _Spaces_, for different teams, projects or departments with defined permission levels for each individual member or group of members. You can also publicly share specific pages, allowing anyone with a link to view them.

Using a rich text editor with built-in support for multiple diagramming tools, you can easily create highly professional and visually appealing content in Docmost. You can also import and export pages in Markdown and HTML formats.

## Workspaces, spaces, and pages

In Docmost, a **_workspace_** is the top-level entity for organizing your documentation and collaboration efforts. It includes all your content, user roles, and permissions. 

Within a workspace, you can create multiple **_spaces_**. Spaces are dedicated, organized areas within your workspace that group together pages, documents, permissions, and members by project, team, or purpose.  

Within a space, you can create and manage individual documents, or **_pages_**, which contain the content itself.

---

### Example: Workspaces, spaces, and pages

For example, you want to create a wiki that holds content related to your organization, divided by departments. 

Here's what you do:

* Create a **_workspace_** and call it the name of your organization, such as **Acme Corp**. 
* Within your workspace, create a **_space_** for each department, such as **HR**, **R&D**, and **Finance**. 
* Within each space, create **_pages_** related to the activities in the department, such as **Annual Goals**, **Dev Roadmap**, and **Planning & Analysis**.

All users are assigned to a default group called **Everyone**.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with **Admin** or **Owner** roles can create, edit, and delete groups.

**Topics**:

* [Create a group](#create-a-group)
* [Edit group settings](#edit-group-settings)
* [Grant group access to a space](#grant-group-access-to-a-space)
* [Add a member to a group](#add-a-member-to-a-group)

![Edit group name and description](../images/DocMost50.png "Edit group name and description")

---

The system saves your updates.

## Grant group access to a space

Instead of adding _individual_ members to a space, you can add _groups_. Assign a specific set of permissions to the entire group. Groups make it easy to grant multiple users access at the same time. In addition, creating groups ensures members have the correct permissions for working in the space.

**Procedure**

1. From your workspace drop-down menu, select **Workspace settings**.

2. From the left pane, under **Settings** and **Workspace**, select **Spaces**.

3. On the **Spaces** screen, select the space for which you want to grant group access.

4. From the **Members** tab, select **Add space members**.

5. On the **Add space members** screen, complete the fields.

---

![Add space members](../images/DocMost51.png "Add space members")

---

|Field          |Description|
|:--------------|:----------| 
|Add members    |Search for and select the group to which you want to grant access to the space.|
|Select role    |Select one of the following permission levels:<ul><li>**Full access**: Has administrative access to all space settings and pages, and full editing privileges.</li><li>**Can edit**: Can create and edit pages in the space, but _cannot_ access space settings.</li><li>**Can view**: Can view all page content but _cannot_ edit any content.</li></ul>

6. Select **Add**.
   
   The system adds the group as a member to the space.

---

![Group added as a space member](../images/DocMost52.png "Group added as a space member")

---

>[!NOTE]
> If a user has been added as an individual member _and_ as a group member to the _same_ space with _different_ permission levels, the highest permission level applies. For example,  Alex Smith has been added as a member to the space, **Research & Development**, with **Can View** permissions. Alex has also been added to the group, **Core Engineering Team**, which has **Can Edit** permissions to this space. Therefore, Alex has edit privileges for this space.
