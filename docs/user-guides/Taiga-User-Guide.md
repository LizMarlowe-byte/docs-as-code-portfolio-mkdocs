## Overview

Taiga helps project managers organize, track, and prioritize work using Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban frameworks. As a powerful alternative to Jira or Trello, Taiga helps teams define deliverables, align priorities, and maintain transparency across ongoing activities and resource allocation.

Using Taiga, you can easily manage daily standups with your team. Create user stories that capture all required tasks, and include attachments, story points, internal requirements, client requests, and dependencies. Generate individual or bulk tasks and drag them into clear status swim lanes on the Sprint Taskboard. Story points, due dates, and blocked tasks are prominently displayed, making it simple to track high-priority items and assist team members facing blockers.

As Taiga offers robust customization options, you can easily configure and customize epics, user stories, tasks, issue workflows, custom fields, role permissions, integrations, and plugins. Create a project wiki for documentation and other content. To encourage team collaboration and engagement, highlight team member skills and contributions on the unique team board, such as highlighting a _Bug Hunter_ for issue reporting. In addition, use Taiga's powerful search capabilities to find any type of data across your project.

   After you create an account, you can create your first [project](#create-a-project). 

## Create a project

Create a _project_, which is the top-level container for organizing your team's work. For example, in a Scrum environment, a project can contain all of your epics, stories, tasks, and issues related to a specific software release.

You can create a Scrum or Kanban project. You can also copy an existing project and modify as required, or import a project from Taiga or other platforms (including Jira, Github, Trello, or Asana).

**Before you begin**

[Create your account](#create-your-account)

**Procedure**

1. From the [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/) home page, select **New Project**.

---

![Select new project](../images/Taiga2.png "Select new project")

---

2. On the **Create Project** screen, select the type of project you want to create.  

   To get more information about Scrum and Kanban, select the information icon 
   <img src="../images/Taiga3a.png" style="width:25px; vertical-align:middle;" /> next to each option.

---

![Create project](../images/Taiga3.png "Create project")

---

|Project Type |Description|
|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Scrum             |Create a Scrum project, which is an iterative and incremental Agile software development methodology for managing product development. <br>Scrum allows you to prioritize and solve your tasks in short time cycles. All work is managed in the product backlog, which contains tasks that are prioritized according to when the work needs to be delivered. <br>Product backlogs are broken down into manageable, specific periods of time called sprints. Each sprint contains specific user stories from the backlog that need to be delivered by the end of that sprint. The project advances as the backlog becomes depleted.    |
|Kanban            |Create a Kanban project, which is a workflow-based Agile software development methodology for managing product development. <br>Kanban allows you to divide project development into stages. Work is managed on Kanban cards, like index cards or post-it notes, where each card details every task or user story that needs to be completed. The Kanban board is used to track progress by moving each card from one stage to the next.
|Duplicate Project |Copy an existing project and modify as required.
|Import Project    |Import a project from Taiga or other platforms (including Jira, Github, Trello, or Asana).

3. If you selected **Scrum**, **Kanban**, or **Duplicate Project**, enter your project details.

> **Note:** If you selected **Duplicate Project**, select the project you want to duplicate, and then enter your project details. If you selected **Import Project**, select the platform of the project you want to import and browse and select the project to import.

![Enter project details](../images/Taiga4.png "Enter project details")

---

|Field |Description|
|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Project Name      |Enter a unique name for your project.|
|Project Description |Enter a description for your project, which can include the type of entities the project will include (epics, stories, tasks, etc.) the target software release, and even details about the team members.
|Public Project / Private Project |Select whether the project is open to all users (**Public**) or just the project's team members (**Private**). <br>The number of public projects you can create is determined by your [Taiga subscription plan](#taiga-deployment-options). For more information, see [What's the difference between public and private projects?](https://community.taiga.io/t/whats-the-difference-between-public-and-private-projects/139)


4. Select **Create Project**.

   The system creates the new project. From here, you can start populating your project with stories, tasks, and issues. <br>For example, if you selected a Scrum project, you can start creating user stories for your product backlog (see [Create a user story](#create-a-user-story)).

---

![New project created](../images/Taiga5.png "New project created")

---

> 💡 **Tip:** Before creating your user stories, you might find it useful to define your project settings, including adding team members to your project, customizing specific Agile entities (such as custom fields and adding new story points), and defining project modules and roles. If that is your preferred workflow, see [Defining project settings](#defining-project-settings).


# Defining project settings { data-toc-label="Defining project settings" }

# Scrum project workflow { data-toc-label="Scrum project workflow" }

In Scrum, work typically moves through two main phases: 

- _Backlog Management_: Prepare and prioritize work by creating and refining epics, user stories and tasks. 

- _Sprint Execution_: Create and plan sprints, assign stories and tasks to members, and track story and task progress through to completion.

---

![Scrum project workflow](../images/Taiga_scrum_project_workflow_new.png "Scrum project workflow")

---

The following table summarizes each step in the workflow.

|Seq.#             |Step                    |Phase             |Description              | Example                         |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|1                 |**[Create epics](#create-an-epic)**        |Backlog Management |Create _epics_, which group related user stories. Together, the user stories in an epic encapsulate work towards a specific product development.| An epic called _User Management Accessibility Redesign_ includes user stories that define development related to accessibility features in the User Management application.             
|2                 |**[Create user stories](#create-a-user-story)**      |Backlog Management      |Within an epic and from the backlog, create _user stories_ that define specific development needed to accomplish the goal of the epic.| In the epic called _User Management Accessibility Redesign_, there's a user story called _Change UI Labels_, which defines changing the UI text headings to comply with WCAG requirements.
|3                 |**[Create tasks](#create-a-task)**             |Backlog Management      |Within each user story, create _tasks_, which break up the story work into smaller, manageable chunks that different members of the team can work on. | For the user story, _Change UI Labels_, there are 3 tasks: _Propose New UI Labels_, _Update Text Labels in DB_, and _Test New UI Labels_. Each task is assigned to a different member of the team.|
|4                 |**[Create a sprint](#create-a-sprint)**           |Sprint Execution        |Create a _sprint_, a timeboxed period for completing user stories.

At the end of a sprint, all stories should have a completed status. |One week into the _DLogix-S1_ sprint, the stories, _Change UI Labels_ and _Create New Filters_ are _In Progress_, and _Enhance Search_ has a dependency on another team that is currently being resolved.

# Scrum backlog management { data-toc-label="Scrum backlog management" }

During backlog management, you prepare and prioritize work by creating the key entities you will use to manage work on a daily basis: _epics_, _user stories_, and _tasks_. Managing these entities and following the Scrum workflow helps you organize and prioritize work, with the goal of delivering value within the defined timebox.

**Topics**:

* [Create an epic](#create-an-epic)
* [Create a user story](#create-a-user-story)
* [Create a task](#create-a-task)

## Create an epic

Create an _epic_, which groups related user stories. Together, the user stories in an epic encapsulate work towards a specific product development. 

For example, an epic called _User Management Accessibility Redesign_ includes user stories that define development related to accessibility features in the User Management application.

**Before you begin**

Review the [Scrum project workflow](#scrum-project-workflow)

**Procedure**

1. From the [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/) home page, under **My projects**, select the project you want.

2. On the project page, from the left sidebar, select **Epics**.

3. Select **+ Add Epic**.

4. On the following screen, enter your epic details.

---

![Enter epic details](../images/Taiga_epic1.png "Enter epic details")

---

|Field             |Description|
|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Color ID          |Select a color that identifies the epic. <br>Alternatively, enter the hexadecimal color code.
|Epic Name      |Enter a unique name for your epic. <br>For example: _User Management Accessibility Redesign_|
|Epic Description |Enter a description for your epic, which should describe the type of product development for the epic. <br>For example: _Improve accessibility features in the User Management module to comply with WCAG 2.1 standards._
|Attachments |If desired, upload or drop any relevant attachments, such as feature specs, customer requirements, etc.|
|Team requirement / Client requirement / Blocked| Select one of the following:<ul><li>**Team requirement**: Work defined by user stories in the epic is work the development team feels is necessary but it is not a direct client request.</li><li>**Client requirement**: Work defined by user stories in the epic is the result of a direct client request. .</li><li>**Blocked**: Work defined by the user stories in this epic currently _cannot_ be done, due to an external dependency or issue preventing its progress.</li></ul>

4. Select **Create Epic**.

   The system creates the new epic, and displays it in a new row on the **Epics** screen. 

---

![New epic created](../images/Taiga_epic2.png "New epic created")

---

|Field             |Description|
|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Name          |Name of the epic.
|Project       |Project associated with the epic. <br>A blank value indicates that the project is the one in which the epic was created (the current project). If the epic was assigned to a project other than the one in which it was created, the name of the project is displayed in this field. |
|Sprint       |Sprint to which the epic is assigned. <br>**Note**: This field is often blank because epics span multiple sprints. They are _not_ single-sprint items. Instead, epics are linked to their specific user stories or tasks, which get assigned to sprints.|
|Assigned     |Member of the project to which the epic is assigned. <br>By default, this field is blank. Typically, this is assigned to the specific team member who is responsible for the high-level goal or initiative of the epic.|
|Status       |Status of the epic. <br>By default, a new epic is set to **New**. Can be set to **New**, **Ready**, **In Progress**, **Ready for Test**, and **Done**.|
|Progress |Calculated rollup that reflects the completion status of all associated user stories (or Kanban cards) linked to the epic. <br>This is _not_ a manually editable field.

**What to do next?**

[**Create a user story**](#create-a-user-story)

## Create a user story

Create a _user story_ that defines specific development needed to accomplish the goal of the epic.

For example, in the epic called _User Management Accessibility Redesign_, create a user story called _Change UI Labels_, which defines changing the UI text headings to comply with WCAG requirements.

> **Note:** There are two ways to create user stories—from the **Epics** dashboard or from the backlog. To emphasize the value of the project workflow, this procedure describes how to create user stories from the **Epics** dashboard. To create a user story from the backlog, select **Scrum** > **Backlog**, select **+ User Story**, and associate the user story with the relevant epic.

**Before you begin**

[Create an epic](#create-an-epic)

**Procedure**

1. Select the epic for which you want to create a user story.

2. Under **Related user stories**, select the **+** icon.

[Scrum sprint execution](#scrum-sprint-execution)

# Scrum sprint execution { data-toc-label="Scrum sprint execution" }

During sprint execution, you deliver the work that was prepared during backlog management. This phase includes planning sprints, assigning prioritized user stories to the sprint backlog, and coordinating daily progress. 

Teams work collaboratively to complete stories within the sprint’s timebox, resolve blockers, and track progress using task boards or burndown charts. At the end of the sprint, completed work is reviewed and demonstrated, and the team reflects on improvements during the retrospective.

**Topics**:

* [Create a sprint](#create-a-sprint)
* [Assign user stories to a sprint](#assign-user-stories-to-a-sprint)
* [Track progress and complete user stories](#track-progress-and-complete-user-stories)

## Create a sprint

Create a _sprint_, a timeboxed period for completing user stories. Typically, multiple sprints are created well in advance of their start dates.

**Before you begin**

Complete all steps in [Scrum backlog management](#scrum-backlog-management)

**Procedure**

1. On the project page, from the left sidebar, select **Scrum** and **Backlog**.

   The backlog displays all existing user stories.

---

![User stories in the backlog](../images/Taiga_sprints1.png "User stories in the backlog")

---  

2. From **Sprints**, select **Add +**.

3. On the **New sprint** screen, enter the name of the sprint and the start and end dates, and select **Save**.

---

![Create new sprint](../images/Taiga_sprints2.png "Create new sprint")

---  

4. Select **Save**.

   Under **Sprints**, the new sprint is now displayed.

**What to do next?**

[Assign user stories to a sprint](#assign-user-stories-to-a-sprint)

## Assign user stories to a sprint

From the backlog, according to deployment priorities, related work, and development dependencies, determine which user stories should be assigned to upcoming sprints, and assign them accordingly.

**Before you begin**

[Create a sprint](#create-a-sprint)

**Procedure**

1. From the **Backlog**, select the user stories you want to move to the sprint you created.

2. Do one of the following:

   - If the sprint to which you want to assign the stories is the latest sprint, select **Move to latest sprint**.

   - Alternatively, drag and drop the selected stories to the sprint you created.

---

![Move stories to sprint](../images/Taiga_assign_user_stories_to_sprints1.png "Move stories to sprint")

--- 

The stories you selected are now assigned to the sprint.

---

![Stories assigned to sprint](../images/Taiga_assign_user_stories_to_sprints2.png "Stories assigned to sprint")

--- 

The application calculates your velocity based on your story points allocated to the sprint. If you can add additional stories to the sprint without exceeding your velocity, the system prompts you to move the candidate user stories to the current sprint.

3. To move candidate user stories to the current sprint, select **Move to Current Sprint**.

   The system updates the assigned stories to the sprint.

**What to do next?**

[Track progress and complete user stories](#track-progress-and-complete-user-stories)

## Track progress and complete user stories

During a sprint, track the status of user stories on the **Sprint Taskboard**. 

During the daily standups, discuss any blockers, issues, and dependencies, and try to resolve them so that members can complete the work defined in the relevant stories. At the end of a sprint, all stories should have a completed status.

**Before you begin**

[Assign user stories to a sprint](#assign-user-stories-to-a-sprint)

**Procedure**

1. From the **Backlog**, select **Sprint Taskboard**.

---

![Select sprint taskboard](../images/Taiga_trackprogress1.png "Select sprint taskboard")

# Project management beyond Scrum { data-toc-label="Project management beyond scrum" }

Beyond Scrum, Taiga supports other project management methodologies. In addition to organizing work into timeboxed sprints and managing tasks and user stories, you can configure Taiga to use a Kanban board for a higher-level view of project progress. Issues may be tracked independently of sprints, and the Team Board can be utilized for any type of project to display team member roles, skills, and contributions.


**Topics**:

* [Manage a Kanban board](#manage-a-kanban-board)
* [Manage issues](#manage-issues)
* [Manage the team board](#manage-the-team-board)


## Manage a Kanban board

Kanban is a high-level workflow-based Agile software development methodology for managing product development. Using Kanban, work is managed on cards, like virtual index cards or post-it notes, where each card details specific work to be completed. The Kanban board is used to track progress by moving each card from one stage to the next until completion.

**Procedure**

1. From the [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/) home page, under **My projects**, select the project you want.

2. On the project page, from the left sidebar, select **Kanban**.

3. To create a new user story for your Kanban project, from any status swim lane, select the **+** icon. <br>For example, to create a new user story called **Enhance Search**, select the **+** icon from the **New** swim lane.

4. On the **New user story** screen, complete the fields.

|Field  |Description                                    |
|:------|:----------------------------------------------|
|Subject |Enter a name for the story.                   |
|Description|Enter the details about the story.        |
|Attachments|Drop any relevant attachments (such as a feature description or development spec).|
|Assign     |To assign the story to a member, select **Assign**, select the member you want. To assign the story to yourself, select **Assign to me**.|
|Points     |Select the area of development you want and enter the number of story points for that area. <br>For example, for a UI story, enter points for **UX** and **Design**. 

5. Select **Create**.

      The system creates the user story in the relevant status swim lane.

---

![New user story created in status swim lane](../images/Taiga_kanban3.png "New user story created in status swim lane")

--- 

6. To create multiple user stories in bulk:

   1. From any status swim lane, select the **Add new bulk** icon <img src="../images/Taiga_trackprogress5.png" alt="Bulk Task icon" width="25" />.

   2. On the **New bulk insert** screen, enter each story name on each line in the text box.

   3. Select **Save**.

     The system creates the user stories in the relevant status swim lanes. 

7. During project status meetings, change the status of stories as required until completion.

## Manage issues

Every project encounters issues, which may include bugs, questions, dependencies, or required enhancements necessary for completion. In Taiga, issues can be managed independently of Scrum or Kanban boards, allowing you to separate core work items from blockers and ancillary tasks. This approach helps maintain focus on primary deliverables while tracking and resolving obstacles efficiently.

**Procedure**

1. From the [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/) home page, under **My projects**, select the project you want.

2. On the project page, from the left sidebar, select **Issues**.

3. To create a new issue, select **+ New Issue**.

4. On the **New issue** screen, complete the fields.

---

![Create new issue](../images/Taiga_issue1.png "Create new issue")

--- 

|Field  |Description                                    |
|:------|:----------------------------------------------|
|Subject |Enter a name for the issue.                   |
|Description |Enter the details about the issue.        |
|Attachments |Drop any relevant attachments (such as a Figma screenshot).|
|Assign or Assign to me |To assign the issue to a member, select **Assign** and select the member you want. To assign the issue to yourself, select **Assign to me**.|
|Type            |Select one of the following: <ul><li>**Bug**</li><li>**Question**</li><li>**Enhancement**</li>|
|Severity        |Select one of the following: <ul><li>**Wishlist**</li><li>**Minor**</li><li>**Normal**</li><li>**Important**</li><li>**Critical**</li></ul>|
|Priority        |Select one of the following: <ul><li>**Low**</li><li>**Normal**</li><li>**High**</li></ul>|

5. Select **Create**.

   The new issue appears on the **Issues** page.

---

![New issue](../images/Taiga_issue2.png "New issue")

--- 

4. To create multiple issues in bulk:

   1. Select the <img src="../images/Taiga_trackprogress5.png" alt="Bulk Task icon" width="25" /> icon.

   2. On the **New bulk insert** screen, enter each issue name on each line in the text box.

   3. Select **Save**.

     The system creates the issues. 

5. To filter existing issues:

   1. Select **Filters**.

   2. Select either **Include** or **Exclude**.

   3. For each attribute (such as **Type**, **Severity**, **Priority**, **Status**, etc.), select the values you want.

---

![Filter issues](../images/Taiga_issue3.png "Filter issues")

--- 

6. As needed, change the status of issues as required until completion.


## Manage the team board

In Taiga, the team board can be utilized for any project type to display team member roles, skills, and contributions. It provides a centralized view of the people working on a project, including their roles, assignments, progress, strengths and skills. It helps teams align around shared objectives and manage capacity more effectively.

**Procedure**

1. From the [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/) home page, under **My projects**, select the project you want.

2. On the project page, from the left sidebar, select **Team**.

   The system displays the team board, which lists all members in the project, their role, and their titles, which highlight their accomplishments.

---

![Team board](../images/Taiga_team1.png "Team board")

--- 

The following table describes the titles on the team board, which highlight team member skills and contributions.

|Title |Description                                    |
|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|
|Mr. Wolf     |Member who has closed many issues.                   |
|Iocaine Drinker|Member who has ingested many iocaine doses. <br>A fictional reference to _The Princess Bride_, a member who has ingested many iocaine doses in Taiga indicates that they have tackled difficult or outside-their-comfort-zone tasks. A user can mark an iocaine dose to indicate they’re tackling a difficult or outside‑their‑comfort‑zone task. (Also referenced on the Sprint Taskboard.)|
|Cervantes    |Member who has edited many wiki pages.|
|Bug Hunter   |Member who has reported many issues.    |
|Night Shift |Member who has closed many tasks.      |
|Total Power |Total number of points, or accomplishments, that the member has achieved.|

3. To filter the team members by role, from **Filters**, select the role you want. <br>For example, to view all UX team members, select **UX**.
