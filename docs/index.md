# 📘 Doc Site Using MkDocs Project

Welcome to the first project in my **Docs-as-Code Portfolio Series**, where I’m building and publishing documentation sites using four different static site generators (SSGs): **MkDocs**, **Hugo**, **Docusaurus**, and **Jekyll**.

This site represents my work with **MkDocs** and demonstrates how I approach modern documentation workflows—from information architecture and content strategy to build automation and publishing.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project { data-toc-label="Purpose of This Project" }

As a Sr. Technical Writer, I’ve used git-based workflows and developer documentation tooling in my work. 

This portfolio series is my opportunity to:

- Strengthen and demonstrate my docs-as-code skills  
- Explore and compare popular SSGs used in engineering teams  
- Showcase real examples of my technical writing  
- Build documentation sites end‑to‑end using best practices  
- Create a curated, public-facing writing and tooling portfolio  

This MkDocs site is **Project 1 of 4** in the series.
